* Variable 
** When you say int64 ==> word sizes are 64 , addresses are 64
** Zero value --> var a int ---> all zeros --> string would have empty  
** Casting 
*** No casting in Go it has conversion --> has extra cost of allocation. 
* Struct 
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
   struct data{
    a bool,  // 1 byte 
    a int16, // 2 bytes  
    a float32 , // 4 bytes
   }
  #+END_SRC
